## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-lite.git
   cd rag-lite
   ```

2. **Set Up Python Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

4. **Install Local LLMs (for local running mode)**
   - Install Ollama and install necessary models:
     ```bash
     # For Inference (requires 5.2 GB)
     ollama pull deepseek-r1:latest

     # For Embedding (requires 669 MB)
     ollama pull mxbai-embed-large
     ```

5. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   cp env.template .env
   # Edit .env and add your OpenAI API and AWS keys
   ```

## 🎮 Usage

1. **Start the Application (app_local.py for local mode)**
   ```bash
   streamlit run rag-lite/app.py
   ```

3. **Configure Retrieval**
   - 🎚️ Adjust "Top K Chunks" slider (1-10)
   - 🎯 Set "Similarity Threshold" (0.0-1.0)
   - 💡 Higher threshold = more relevant but fewer results

4. **Ask Questions**
   - ❓ Type your question in the chat input
   - 🤖 Get responses with evidence citations
   - 📚 See which sections of your documents were used

## 🎯 Example Queries

```
Q: What are the main points in the introduction?
A: Based on Section 1 (Introduction), the main points are...

Q: Summarize the methodology section.
A: According to Section 3.2 (Methodology), the approach involves...
```

## 🛠️ Advanced Configuration

### Chunking Strategy
The system uses a hierarchical chunking strategy based on document structure:
- 📑 Respects document hierarchy (chapters, sections, subsections)
- 🎯 Maintains context through section headings
- 🔍 Preserves relationships between chunks

### Retrieval Settings
- **Top K**: Number of chunks to retrieve (default: 3)
- **Similarity Threshold**: Minimum similarity score (default: 0.6)
  - 0.8-1.0: Very strict matching
  - 0.6-0.8: Balanced retrieval
  - 0.4-0.6: More exploratory results
